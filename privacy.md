##Privacy Policy##

All apps must post a privacy policy in both the designated field in Play Console and within the app itself. The privacy policy must, together with any in-app disclosures, comprehensively disclose how your app accesses, collects, uses, and shares user data, not limited by the data disclosed in the Data Safety section. This must include: 

developer information and a privacy point of contact or a mechanism to submit inquiries
disclosing the types of personal and sensitive user data your app accesses, collects, uses, and shares; and any parties with which any personal or sensitive user data is shared
secure data handling procedures for personal and sensitive user data
the developer’s data retention and deletion policy
clear labeling as a privacy policy (e.g., listed as “privacy policy” in title)
The entity (e.g., developer, company) named in the app’s Google Play listing must appear in the privacy policy or the app must be named in the privacy policy. Apps that do not access any personal and sensitive user data must still submit a privacy policy. 

Please make sure your privacy policy is available on an active URL (no PDFs) and is non-editable.
